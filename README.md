# Frontend Interview Questions

This repository contains up-to-date interview questions from interviews. The objective is to help you pass these technical interviews. We all know these questions doesn't really prove 100% your coding skills and sometimes even though you know the answer but you don't know the exact terminology to express your self. But it is something we all have to do, you like it or not.

Even though some of these questions seems pretty easy, I recommend you to look at all the answers because there is a big chance that you learn something you didn't know even from the easy questions.

> My personal recommendation is that even if you are not currently looking for a job, you start learning this knowledge asap so whenever you feel like applying for jobs you are ready to jump into it, and it also will improve your coding skills.

  ## Contribute

It would really help the quality of the project if people who are currently taking job interviews (like myself) add the questions they have been asked. So the repository is always up-to-date. Be sure to write the same answer and in many cases if the answer is too long you can link an article that has a good explanation of the question. 

I believe in the core concept on understand the answers rather than learn them by heart. So I would appreciate if all the contributors have the same philosophy in mind.
